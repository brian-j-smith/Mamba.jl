Chains
------

``AbstractChains`` subtypes store output from one or more runs (chains) of an MCMC sampler.  They serve as containers for output generated by the :func:`mcmc` function, and supply methods for convergence diagnostics and posterior inference.  Moreover, they can be used as stand-alone containers for any user-generated MCMC output, and are thus a **julia** analogue to the `boa` :cite:`smith:2007:BOA,smith:2008:BOA` and `coda` :cite:`plummer:2006:CDO,plummer:2012:CDO` **R** packages.

.. index:: Convergence Diagnostics

.. _section-Convergence-Diagnostics:

Convergence Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MCMC simulation provides autocorrelated samples from a target distribution.  Because of computational complexities in implementing MCMC algorithms, the autocorrelated nature of samples, and the need to choose initial sampling values at different points in target distributions; it is important to evaluate the quality of resulting output.  Specifically, one should check that MCMC samples have converged to the target (or, more commonly, are stationary) and that the number of convergent samples provides sufficiently accurate and precise estimates of posterior statistics.

Several established convergence diagnostics are supplied by *Mamba*.  The diagnostics and their features are summarized in the table below and described in detail in the subsequent function descriptions.  They differ with respect to the posterior statistic being assessed (mean vs. quantile), whether the application is to parameters univariately or multivariately, and the number of chains required for calculations.  Diagnostics may assess stationarity, estimation accuracy and precision, or both.  A more comprehensive comparative review can be found in :cite:`cowles:1996:MCM`.  Since diagnostics differ in their focus and design, it is often good practice to employ more than one to assess convergence.  Note too that diagnostics generally test for non-convergence and that non-significant test results do not prove convergence.  Thus, non-significant results should be interpreted with care.

Discrete Diagnostic
```````````````````

.. function:: discretediag(c::AbstractChains; frac::Real=0.3, method::Symbol=:weiss, \
                           nsim::Int=1000)

    Compute the convergence diagnostic for a discrete variable.  Several options are available by choosing `method` to be one of `:hangartner, :weiss, :DARBOOT, MCBOOT, :billinsgley, :billingsleyBOOT`. The first four are based off of Pearson's chi-square test of homogeneity. The diagnostic tests whether the proportion of the categories of the discrete variable are similar in each chain. The last two methods test whether the transition probabilities between each category are similar between each chain. Along with a between chain assessment of convergence, a within-chain assessment is carried out by comparing a specified fraction (`frac`), or window, of the beginning of a chain to the specified fraction of the end of the chain.  For within-chain assessment, users should ensure that there is sufficient separation between the windows to assume that their samples are independent.  A non-significant test p-value indicates convergence.  Significant p-values indicate non-convergence and the possible need to discard initial samples as a burn-in sequence or to simulate additional samples.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``frac`` : proportion of iterations to include in the first window.
        * ``method`` : Specify which method to use. One of :hangartner, :weiss, :DARBOOT, MCBOOT, :billinsgley, :billingsleyBOOT`.
        * ``nsim`` : For the bootstrap methods (`:DARBOOT`, `:MCBOOT`, and `:billingsleyBOOT`) the number of bootstrap simulations.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field. The first three columns correspond to the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value of the between-chain assessment. The next columns are the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value for each chain of the within-chain assessment.

.. function:: gelmandiag(c::AbstractChains; alpha::Real=0.05, mpsrf::Bool=false, \
                         transform::Bool=false)

    Compute the convergence diagnostics of Gelman, Rubin, and Brooks :cite:`gelman:1992:IIS,brooks:1998:GMM` for MCMC sampler output.  The diagnostics are designed to asses convergence of posterior means estimated with multiple autocorrelated samples (chains).  They does so by comparing the between and within-chain variances with metrics called *potential scale reduction factors (PSRF)*.  Both univariate and multivariate factors are available to assess the convergence of parameters individually and jointly.  Scale factors close to one are indicative of convergence.  As a rule of thumb, convergence is concluded if the 0.975 quantile of an estimated factor is less than 1.2.  Multiple chains are required for calculations.  It is recommended that at least three chains be generated, each with different starting values chosen to be diffuse with respect to the anticipated posterior distribution.  Use of multiple chains in the diagnostic provides for more robust assessment of convergence than is possible with single chain diagnostics.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``alpha`` : quantile (``1 - alpha / 2``) at which to estimate the upper limits of scale reduction factors.
        * ``mpsrf`` : whether to compute the multivariate potential scale reduction factor.  This factor will not be calculable if any one of the parameters in the output is a linear combination of others.
        * ``transform`` : whether to apply log or logit transformations, as appropriate, to parameters in the chain to potentially produce output that is more normally distributed, an assumption of the PSRF formulations.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object of the form:

        .. index:: ChainSummary

        .. code-block:: julia

            immutable ChainSummary
              value::Array{Float64, 3}

              header::AbstractString
            end

        with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field, and scale reduction factors and upper-limit quantiles in the first and second columns.

                         etype=:imse, args...)

    Compute the convergence diagnostic of Geweke :cite:`geweke:1992:EAS` for MCMC sampler output.  The diagnostic is designed to asses convergence of posterior means estimated with autocorrelated samples.  It computes a normal-based test statistic comparing the sample means in two windows containing proportions of the first and last iterations.  Users should ensure that there is sufficient separation between the two windows to assume that their samples are independent.  A non-significant test p-value indicates convergence.  Significant p-values indicate non-convergence and the possible need to discard initial samples as a burn-in sequence or to simulate additional samples.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``first`` : proportion of iterations to include in the first window.
        * ``last`` : proportion of iterations to include in the last window.
        * ``etype`` : method for computing Monte Carlo standard errors.  See :func:`mcse` for options.
        * ``args...`` : additional arguments to be passed to the ``etype`` method.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field, and test Z-scores and p-values in the first and second columns.  Results are chain-specific.

                         args...)

    Compute the convergence diagnostic of Heidelberger and Welch :cite:`heidelberger:1983:SRL` for MCMC sampler output.  The diagnostic is designed to assess convergence of posterior means estimated with autocorrelated samples and to determine whether a target degree of accuracy is achieved.  A stationarity test is performed for convergence assessment by iteratively discarding 10\% of the initial samples until the test p-value is non-significant and stationarity is concluded or until 50\% have been discarded and stationarity is rejected, whichever occurs first.  Then, a halfwidth test is performed by calculating the relative halfwidth of a posterior mean estimation interval as :math:`z_{1 - \alpha / 2} \hat{s} / |\bar{\theta}|`; where :math:`z` is a standard normal quantile, :math:`\hat{s}` is the Monte Carlo standard error, and :math:`\bar{\theta}` is the estimated posterior mean.  If the relative halfwidth is greater than a target ratio, the test is rejected.  Rejection of the stationarity or halfwidth test suggests that additional samples are needed.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``alpha`` : significance level for evaluations of stationarity tests and calculations of relative estimation interval halfwidths.
        * ``eps`` : target ratio for the relative halfwidths.
        * ``etype`` : method for computing Monte Carlo standard errors.  See :func:`mcse` for options.
        * ``args...`` : additional arguments to be passed to the ``etype`` method.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field, and numbers of burn-in sequences to discard, whether the stationarity tests are passed (1 = yes, 0 = no), their p-values (:math:`p > \alpha` implies stationarity), posterior means, halfwidths of their :math:`(1 - \alpha) 100\%` estimation intervals, and whether the halfwidth tests are passed (1 = yes, 0 = no) in the columns.  Results are chain-specific.

                          eps::Real=0.001)

    Compute the convergence diagnostic of Raftery and Lewis :cite:`raftery:1992:OLR,raftery:1992:HMI` for MCMC sampler output.  The diagnostic is designed to determine the number of autocorrelated samples required to estimate a specified quantile :math:`\theta_q`, such that :math:`\Pr(\theta \le \theta_q) = q`, within a desired degree of accuracy.  In particular, if :math:`\hat{\theta}_q` is the estimand and :math:`\Pr(\theta \le \hat{\theta}_q) = \hat{P}_q` the estimated cumulative probability, then accuracy is specified in terms of :math:`r` and :math:`s`, where :math:`\Pr(q - r < \hat{P}_q < q + r) = s`.  Thinning may be employed in the calculation of the diagnostic to satisfy its underlying assumptions.  However, users may not want to apply the same (or any) thinning when estimating posterior summary statistics because doing so results in a loss of information.  Accordingly, sample sizes estimated by the diagnostic tend to be conservative (too large).

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``q`` : posterior quantile of interest.
        * ``r`` : margin of error for estimated cumulative probabilities.
        * ``s`` : probability for the margin of error.
        * ``eps`` : tolerance within which the probabilities of transitioning from initial to retained iterations are within the equilibrium probabilities for the chain.  This argument determines the number of samples to discard as a burn-in sequence and is typically left at its default value.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field, and thinning intervals employed, numbers of samples to discard as burn-in sequences, total numbers (:math:`N`) to burn-in and retain, numbers of independent samples that would be needed (:math:`Nmin`), and dependence factors (:math:`N / Nmin`) in the columns.  Results are chain-specific.

        * ``lags`` : lags at which to compute autocorrelations.
        * ``relative`` : whether the lags are relative to the thinning interval of the output (``true``) or relative to the absolute iteration numbers (``false``).

    Estimate the probability, or rate per iteration, :math:`\Pr(\theta^i \ne \theta^{i-1})` of a state space change for iterations :math:`i = 2, \ldots, N` in MCMC sampler output.  Estimation is performed for each parameter univariately as well as for the full parameter vector multivariately.  For continuous output generated from samplers, like Metropolis-Hastings, whose algorithms conditionally accept candidate draws, the probability can be viewed as the acceptance rate.

        See the :ref:`section-Line-Summaries` section of the tutorial.

.. index:: Posterior Summaries; Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Intervals

.. function:: hpd(c::AbstractChains; alpha::Real=0.05)

    Compute highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of Chen and Shao :cite:`chen:1999:MCE` for MCMC sampler output.  HPD intervals have the desirable property of being the smallest intervals that contain a given probability.  However, their calculation assumes unimodal marginal posterior distributions, and they are not invariant to transformations of parameters like central (quantile-based) posterior intervals.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output on which to perform calculations.
        * ``alpha`` : the ``100 * (1 - alpha)``\% interval to compute.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with parameters contained in the rows of the ``value`` field, and lower and upper intervals in the first and second columns.  Results are for all chains combined.

    **Example**

        See the :ref:`section-Line-Summaries` section of the tutorial.

Model-Based Inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)

.. function:: dic(mc::ModelChains)

    Compute the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) of Spiegelhalter et al. :cite:`spiegelhalter:2002:BMM` and Gelman et al. :cite:`gelman:2013:bda` from MCMC sampler output.

    **Arguments**

        * ``mc`` : sampler output from a model fit with the :func:`mcmc` function.

    **Value**

        A ``ChainSummary`` type object with DIC results from the methods of Spiegelhalter and Gelman in the first and second rows of the ``value`` field, and the DIC value and effective numbers of parameters in the first and second columns; where

        .. math::

            \text{DIC} = -2 \mathcal{L}(\bar{\Theta}) + 2 p,

        such that :math:`\mathcal{L}(\bar{\Theta})` is the log-likelihood of model outputs given the expected values of model parameters :math:`\Theta`, and :math:`p` is the effective number of parameters.  The latter is defined as :math:`p_D = -2 \bar{\mathcal{L}}(\Theta) + 2 \mathcal{L}(\bar{\Theta})` for the method of Spiegelhalter and as :math:`p_V = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{var}(-2 \mathcal{L}(\Theta))` for the method of Gelman.  Results are for all chains combined.

    **Value**

        A ``ModelChains`` object of draws simulated at each MCMC iteration of the supplied chain.  For observed data node :math:`y`, simulation is from the posterior predictive distribution

        .. math::

            p(\tilde{y} | y) = \int p(\tilde{y} | \Theta) p(\Theta | y) d\Theta,

        where :math:`\tilde{y}` is an unknown observation on the node, :math:`p(\tilde{y} | \Theta)` is the data likelihood, and :math:`p(\Theta | y)` is the posterior distribution of unobserved parameters :math:`\Theta`.

Plotting
^^^^^^^^

.. index:: Posterior Summaries; Plotting

                   legend::Bool=false, args...)
              plot(c::AbstractChains, ptype::Symbol; legend::Bool=false, args...)

    Various plots to summarize sampler output stored in ``AbstractChains`` subtypes.  Separate plots are produced for each sampled parameter.

    **Arguments**

        * ``c`` : sampler output to plot.
        * ``ptype`` : plot type(s).  Options are
            * ``:autocor`` : autocorrelation plots, with optional argument ``maxlag::Integer=round(Int, 10 * log10(length(c.range)))`` determining the maximum autocorrelation lag to plot.  Lags are plotted relative to the thinning interval of the output.
            * ``:bar`` : bar plots.  Optional argument ``position::Symbol=:stack`` controls whether bars should be stacked on top of each other (default) or placed side by side (``:dodge``).
            * ``:contour`` : pairwise posterior density contour plots.  Optional argument ``bins::Integer=100`` controls the plot resolution.
            * ``:density`` : density plots.  Optional argument ``trim::Tuple{Real, Real}=(0.025, 0.975)`` trims off lower and upper quantiles of density.
            * ``:mean`` : running mean plots.
            * ``:mixeddensity`` : bar plots (``:bar``) for parameters with integer values within bounds defined by optional argument ``barbounds::Tuple{Real, Real}=(0, Inf)``, and density plots (``:density``) otherwise.
            * ``:trace`` : trace plots.
        * ``legend`` : whether to include legends in the plots to identify chain-specific results.
        * ``args...`` : additional keyword arguments to be passed to the ``ptype`` options, as described above.

    **Value**

        Returns a ``Vector{Plot}`` whose elements are individual parameter plots of the specified type if ``ptype`` is a symbol, and a ``Matrix{Plot}`` with plot types in the rows and parameters in the columns if ``ptype`` is a vector.  The result can be displayed or saved to a file with ``draw()``.

    **Note**

        Plots are created using the `Gadfly` package :cite:`jones:2014:GP`.

    **Example**

        See the :ref:`section-Line-Plotting` section of the tutorial.

.. function:: draw(p::Array{Plot}; fmt::Symbol=:svg, filename::AbstractString="", \
                   width::MeasureOrNumber=8inch, height::MeasureOrNumber=8inch, \
                   nrow::Integer=3, ncol::Integer=2, byrow::Bool=true, \
                   ask::Bool=true)

  Draw plots produced by :func:`plot` into display grids containing a default of 3 rows and 2 columns of plots.

    **Arguments**

        * ``p`` : plots to be drawn.  Elements of ``p`` are read in the order stored by **julia** (e.g. column-major order for matrices) and written to the display grid according to the ``byrow`` argument.  Grids will be filled sequentially until all plots have been drawn.
        * ``fmt`` : output format. Options are
            * ``:pdf`` : Portable Document Format (.pdf).
            * ``:pgf`` : Portable Graphics Format (.pgf).
            * ``:png`` : Portable Network Graphics (.png).
            * ``:ps``  : Postscript (.ps).
            * ``:svg`` : Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg).
        * ``filename`` : file to which to save the display grids as they are drawn, or an empty string to draw to the display device (default).  If a supplied external file name does not include a dot (``.``), then a hyphen followed by the grid sequence number and then the format extension will be appended automatically.  In the case of multiple grids, the former file name behavior will write all grids to the single named file, but prompt users before advancing to the next grid and overwriting the file; the latter behavior will write each grid to a different file.
        * ``width/height`` : grid widths/heights in ``cm``, ``mm``, ``inch``, ``pt``, or ``px`` units.
        * ``nrow/ncol`` : number of rows/columns in the display grids.
        * ``byrow`` : whether the display grids should be filled by row.
        * ``ask`` : whether to prompt users before displaying subsequent grids to a single named file or the display device.

    **Value**

        Grids drawn to an external file or the display device.

    **Example**

        See the :ref:`section-Line-Plotting` section of the tutorial.
